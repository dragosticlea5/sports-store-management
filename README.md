Project Summary: Sports Store Management System
Description:
The Sports Store Management System is a comprehensive CRUD-based application developed using the Spring Boot framework for the backend and React.js for the frontend. It provides a complete solution for managing various entities related to a sports store, including categories, products, customers, orders, and reviews. The system uses a layered architecture, with DTOs, mappers, services, repositories, and controllers to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainable code. The frontend offers a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the backend services, supporting all CRUD operations for the key entities.

Backend: Spring Boot Application
Technologies Used:

Spring Boot
Spring Data JPA
H2 Database (for testing and in-memory operations)
PostgreSQL (for production)
Lombok
MapStruct (for mappers)
RESTful API Development
JUnit and Mockito (for testing)
Architecture and Design:

Entities:

Category: Represents product categories (e.g., Apparel, Footwear).
Relationships: One-to-Many with Products.
Product: Represents products in the store.
Relationships: Many-to-One with Category, One-to-Many with Reviews.
Customer: Represents customers.
Relationships: One-to-Many with Orders, One-to-Many with Reviews.
Order: Represents customer orders.
Relationships: Many-to-One with Customer.
Review: Represents customer reviews for products.
Relationships: Many-to-One with Product, Many-to-One with Customer.
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):

Each entity has a corresponding DTO to handle request and response objects.
Used to avoid exposing internal database models and ensure proper data encapsulation.
Mappers:

Implemented using custom mappers and MapStruct to convert between entities and DTOs.
Simplifies the mapping logic and ensures a clean and maintainable codebase.
Service Layer:

Business logic and validation are encapsulated in the service layer.
Communicates with the repository layer to handle CRUD operations and any business rules.
Controller Layer:

RESTful controllers are implemented for each entity.
Each controller handles standard CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
Includes additional endpoints for advanced querying and filtering.
Exception Handling:

Custom exceptions like ResourceNotFoundException are used to provide meaningful error messages.
Global exception handler with @ControllerAdvice ensures consistent and user-friendly error responses.
Database Integration:

H2 in-memory database used during initial development and testing.
Switched to PostgreSQL for production to ensure persistence and scalability.
Testing:

Unit and integration tests are created using JUnit and Mockito.
Over 70% test coverage ensures reliability and stability of the code.
Frontend: React.js Application
Technologies Used:

React.js
React Router DOM (for routing)
Axios (for API calls)
CSS (for styling)
Features:

CRUD Operations for All Entities:

Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete Categories, Products, Customers, Orders, and Reviews.
A clear and intuitive UI ensures smooth navigation between different operations.
Entity Management:

Category Management: Add, update, delete, and list categories.
Product Management: Full CRUD operations for products, with additional filtering by category.
Customer Management: Manage customer details.
Order Management: Create and view orders for customers.
Review Management: Add reviews for products, filter reviews by product or customer.
Search and Filtering:

Allows filtering of products by category.
Allows filtering of reviews by product or customer.
User Interface Design:

A clean UI design using minimal CSS to keep the focus on functionality.
Buttons and forms are styled for usability and responsiveness.
Routing and Navigation:

Navigation is managed using React Router DOM.
Provides a simple menu for navigating between different sections.
State Management and API Integration:

State management handled using Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks.
Axios is used to handle HTTP requests to the Spring Boot backend.
Error handling and response validation for better UX.
